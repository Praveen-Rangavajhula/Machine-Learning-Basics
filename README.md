# Basic ML Models Repository

## Overview

This repository contains implementations of various basic machine learning models for educational purposes. The project is designed to deepen and consolidate theoretical knowledge by providing practical implementations of commonly used models.

## Project Structure

- **`src/`**: Contains scripts for training and evaluating models.
  - `training.py`: The script is currently unused, but will be used for training the Linear Regression model. More training scripts will be added for other models.

- **`model/`**: Contains individual scripts for different machine learning models.
  - `linear_regression.py`: Contains the implementation and training of the Linear Regression model. Additional model scripts will be added here.

- **`data/`**: Contains data-related scripts and files.
  - `data_loader.py`: Script for loading and preprocessing datasets. This will be used by the model training scripts.

- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists the Python packages required for the project.

- **`.gitignore`**: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.

## Collaboration

This project is being developed collaboratively by Praveen Rangavajhula and Ritvik Singhal. We aim to:
- **Learn**: Deepen our understanding of various machine learning models through hands-on implementation.
- **Share Knowledge**: Benefit from each other's strengths and feedback.
- **Divide Tasks**: Split responsibilities to manage the workload effectively.

## Current Status

- **Folder Structure**: Established and organized.
- **Implemented Models**: Linear Regression model has been successfully implemented.
- **Next Steps**: Begin implementing the Linear Regression model and additional models, complete data preprocessing, and extend training scripts for each model.
