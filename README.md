# Basic ML Models Repository

## Overview

This repository contains implementations of various basic machine learning models for educational purposes. The project aims to deepen theoretical knowledge through practical implementations.

## Project Structure

- **`src/`**: Scripts for training and evaluating models.
  - `training.py`: Training script for the Linear Regression model.

- **`model/`**: Scripts for different machine learning models.
  - `linear_regression.py`: Implementation and training of the Linear Regression model.
  - `visualization.py`: Functions for visualizing model performance.

- **`data/`**: Data-related scripts and files.
  - `data_loader.py`: Loading and preprocessing datasets.

- **`requirements.txt`**: Python packages required for the project.
- **`.gitignore`**: Files and directories to be ignored by Git.

## Collaboration

Developed collaboratively by Praveen Rangavajhula and Ritvik Singhal to:
- **Learn**: Deepen understanding of machine learning models.
- **Share Knowledge**: Benefit from each other's strengths and feedback.
- **Divide Tasks**: Manage workload effectively.

## Current Status

- **Folder Structure**: Established and organized.
- **Implemented Models**: Linear Regression model.
- **Visualization**: Functions for visualizing model performance.
- **Next Steps**: Implement additional models, complete data preprocessing, and extend training scripts.
