    "## 1. Overview\n",
    "Data preprocessing is a crucial step in the machine learning pipeline that involves transforming raw data into a clean and usable format. It is essential for enhancing model performance and ensuring accurate predictions. Proper preprocessing can lead to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Improved Model Accuracy**: By cleaning and organizing data, models can better learn the underlying patterns, leading to more accurate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reduction of Overfitting**: Through techniques like feature selection and normalization, preprocessing helps in mitigating overfitting, allowing the model to generalize better to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Handling Missing Values**: In many datasets, missing values can significantly impact model training and performance. Effective preprocessing strategies can address these gaps, ensuring that the model is trained on complete data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Feature Scaling**: Many machine learning algorithms, especially those based on distance metrics, are sensitive to the scale of the data. Preprocessing can involve scaling features to ensure that all input variables contribute equally to the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Enhanced Interpretability**: Clean and well-organized data can make the model's outputs more interpretable, allowing for better insights and understanding of the underlying relationships in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will focus on the preprocessing steps applied to the diabetes dataset, which is already normalized and does not contain any missing values. We will load the dataset, explore its features, and apply necessary transformations to prepare it for modeling.\n"

    "The diabetes dataset is already normalized, and there are no missing values, as explored in the [1_EDA_diabetes.ipynb](1_EDA_diabetes.ipynb) notebook. However, the target variable exhibited slight right-skewness. After experimenting with different transformations such as logarithmic and square root in the exploratory phase, the **Box-Cox** transformation was chosen as it effectively normalizes the target variable while maintaining a Gaussian-like distribution. The log transformation, while common, caused some left-skewness, making **Box-Cox** the more appropriate option given the positive nature of the target values.\n",
